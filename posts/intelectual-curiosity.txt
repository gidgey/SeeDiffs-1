To learn is the highest honor
To embrace the unnkown
The perhaps not knowable
With a clear determination
That others have succeeded before you
That the rewards seem well worth the risks
That alternative
Is stagnation
Is regression
Is irrelevancy
And that seems more horrific
Than any struggle could
Defining your bravery
With cold blue lines
